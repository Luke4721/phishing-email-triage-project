# User Awareness Guidance: Recognizing Phishing Emails

Phishing emails are designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Protect yourself by following these tips:

- **Verify the senderâ€™s email address:** Look out for misspelled domains or unexpected senders.
- **Hover over links:** Before clicking, hover your mouse pointer over links to check the real URL. Avoid suspicious or unknown domains.
- **Watch for urgent or threatening language:** Scammers often create a false sense of urgency or fear.
- **Avoid opening attachments from unknown senders:** Attachments can contain malware or ransomware.
- **Check for poor grammar or spelling mistakes:** Many phishing emails contain errors.
- **Do not reply to suspicious emails:** Never provide your credentials or personal info in response.
- **Report suspicious emails:** Forward phishing emails to your security team immediately.

Stay vigilant and when in doubt, verify with colleagues or IT support before taking any action.
